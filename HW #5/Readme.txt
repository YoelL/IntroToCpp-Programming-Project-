TraverseNeverlandCity....

Yoel Lev, ID ••••••

The program is designed with a Graph Class and a Main function.
The Main function validates all of the parameters that are entered in the Terminal and verifies them one by one.
if all of the parameters are good the the Graph is initiated with all of the data from file\s and asks the user "Where would he likes to travel ?"
if a place does not exists it will print "does not exist in the current network".
in the Graph class there are Exceptions classes that catches problems of different sorts  if needed.

i added a file that i made for an example, called MiddleEarth.txt
to run the program in the terminal -> ./traverseNeverlandCity.out MiddleEarth.txt 
(without a spcific file name )
or 

./traverseNeverlandCity.out MiddleEarth.txt -oMyOutputFile

(wit a spcific file name )

the program was successfully compiled with all flags necessary.

Enjoy.
